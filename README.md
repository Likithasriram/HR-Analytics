# 📊 HR Analytics & Employee Attrition Prediction

A complete end-to-end Data Analytics + SQL + Machine Learning project designed to analyze workforce trends, identify attrition drivers, and build a predictive model to estimate employee churn.

##🚀 Project Overview

Employee attrition leads to loss of talent, higher recruitment costs, and decreased productivity.
This project analyzes 5,000+ employee records to uncover:

- Why employees leave  
- Which departments face higher attrition  
- Key factors influencing churn  
- Predictive modeling to identify at-risk employees  


This project includes:

✔ SQL-based HR analysis

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔ Machine Learning classification

✔ Feature importance insights

✔ Exported .pkl model for deployment

##🧪 SQL Analysis

The file Hr analytics sql queries.sql includes 20+ professional SQL queries covering:

### ✔ Workforce Insights
- Department-wise employee count  
- Gender distribution  
- Tenure patterns  

### ✔ Compensation Analysis
- Salary trends by department  
- Bonus vs attrition  
- Highest-paid roles  

### ✔ Attrition KPIs
- Attrition rate & counts  
- Attrition by job role  
- Overtime impact  
- Satisfaction vs attrition  

### ✔ Promotion & Performance
- Years since last promotion  
- Performance rating distribution  

These queries provide deep HR domain analytics and SQL proficiency.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes:

- Correlation heatmap  
- Salary vs Attrition analysis  
- Department-wise Attrition chart  
- Satisfaction level distributions  
- Tenure & promotion insights  

These visual patterns help uncover the root causes of attrition.


## 🤖 Machine Learning Modeling

### 🔧 Preprocessing Pipeline
- OneHotEncoder for categorical columns  
- StandardScaler for numeric values  
- Train/Test split with stratification  

### 🧠 Models Trained
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

### 🏆 Model Selection Criteria
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **ROC-AUC** (final decision metric)  

Best model saved as:


models/attrition_model.pkl



### 📌 Feature Importance
Random Forest identifies the top predictors:

- Job Satisfaction  
- Environment Satisfaction  
- Overtime  
- Salary  
- Years at Company  


## 💡 Key Insights

- 🔸 Low satisfaction scores strongly correlate with attrition  
- 🔸 Overtime workers have substantially higher churn risk  
- 🔸 Certain job roles show higher attrition than others  
- 🔸 Employees with lower salary ranges leave more often  
- 🔸 Remote workers tend to stay longer  
- 🔸 Very new and long-tenured employees show distinct churn tendencies  


## 📦 Sample Model Prediction

Prediction: **1 (Likely to Leave)**  
Probability: **0.78**

This enables HR teams to proactively identify employees needing attention.
